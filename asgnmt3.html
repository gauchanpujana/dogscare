   <h1>Web Engineering</h1> 
   <p>Web engineering focuses on the methodologies, techniques, and tools that are the foundation of Web application development and which support their design, development, evolution, and evaluation. Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development. Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas: systems analysis and design, software engineering, hypermedia/hypertext engineering, requirements engineering, human-computer interaction, user interface, data engineering, information science, information indexing and retrieval, testing, modelling and simulation, project management, and graphic design and presentation. Web engineering is neither a clone nor a subset of software engineering, although both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of Web-based applications. </p>
<p>Advantages of web engineering are:</p>
   <ol type="a">
<li>Processes, techniques and principles that can improve upon the development, deployment and management of sites and Web applications saving time and valuable resources</li> 
<li>Better metrics and ROI benchmarks that can be shared across departments, business units and among external clients</li>
<li>A respectable title to existing skill sets that are often misunderstood and taken for granted by human resource and hiring manager communities </li>
</ol>
<p> Disadvantages of web engineering are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li> A web app is directly linked to a web browser. Due to this, the app size tends to get increased. The impact of this can be seen in the performance of a web application. A large web app performs considerably slower than a native desktop app.</li>
<li>Web apps lacks the feature of quality control system. As a result, both safety and security is reduced to a higher level. However, by the methods such as SSL enforcement, the users can prevent data breach to some extent. </li>
<li>Web apps are rare to find since they are not available in any App Store or Play Store. Thus, it is difficult to make an awareness among audiences that such apps are available. Only the audience knowing their apps will be visiting through the respective website.</li>
</ul>
